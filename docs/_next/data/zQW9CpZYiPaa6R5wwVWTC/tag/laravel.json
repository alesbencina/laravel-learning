Laravel provides support with certain default functionality to handle events in an application.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a good tool for maintaining abstraction and prioritizing clean code standards.&nbsp;</p><p>We often overload our classes with functionalities, which causes the functionality of many of our applications to break if the class changes.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not a good practice, and this is when events come in handy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Code:</p><p><code>neki</code></p><p>&nbsp;</p><pre><code class=\"php-code\">\npublic function up()\n{\n    Schema::create('subscribers', function (Blueprint $table) {\n        $table-&gt;id();\n        $table-&gt;string('email');\n        $table-&gt;timestamps();\n    });\n}</code></pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","url_alias":"123123","tag_id":null,"author_id":16,"status":1,"summary":"Events are occurrences within a system you may be developing in which the system is notified so that your code can respond to that occurrence.
